Our collaborative study with partners across Norway, Austria, and the US just appeared in _Nature Communications_ (doi:[10.1038/s41467-024-48245-w](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48245-w)). We dissected how hole hopping pathways tune the activity of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases, combining spectroscopy, kinetics, and computation. Congratulations to Iván Ayuso-Fernández for leading the charge and to the full author team for a fantastic effort.

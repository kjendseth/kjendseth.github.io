Åsmund Røhr Kjendseth is an associate professor of physical biochemistry at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU), where he leads the Kjendseth Lab within the Faculty of Chemistry, Biotechnology and Food Science (KBM). His team combines spectroscopy, structural biology, and computational chemistry to understand how lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) and other redox-active enzymes transform recalcitrant biomass.

### Research focus

* Redox chemistry and reaction pathways of LPMOs across bacterial systems  
* Spectroscopic probes for enzyme intermediates and oxygen activation  
* Computational workflows that integrate quantum chemical and molecular simulations with experiment  
* Enzyme engineering strategies for sustainable biomass valorization

### Highlights

* Leads collaborative projects with NMBU and Nordic partners on biofilm regulation and enzymatic biomass conversion.  
* Regular speaker at the Hylleraas Centre for Quantum Molecular Sciences, most recently presenting *How experiments drive our understanding of LPMO reactivity* (Oslo, February 2025).  
* Supervises a growing team of PhD candidates and postdocs working at the interface of structural biology and biocatalysis.

I am always happy to hear from potential collaborators and prospective students who are excited about enzyme mechanisms, spectroscopy, and computational chemistry.

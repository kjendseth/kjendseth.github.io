Åsmund Røhr Kjendseth leads the Kjendseth Lab at NMBU’s Faculty of Chemistry, Biotechnology and Food Science, where he also serves as Head of Education (Pro-Dean) and Section Leader for Chemistry. We mix robotics, spectroscopy, and computation to explain how redox enzymes remodel biomass and point the way to resilient biocatalysts.

### Research focus

- Redox chemistry and reaction pathways of LPMOs across bacterial systems
- Spectroscopic probes for enzyme intermediates and oxygen activation
- Computational workflows that integrate quantum chemical and molecular simulations with experiment
- Enzyme engineering strategies for sustainable biomass valorization

### Highlights

- Leads collaborative projects with NMBU and Nordic partners on carbon-negative catalysis and enzymatic biomass conversion.
- Principal Investigator on the FRIPRO-funded COOFIX programme and co-PI on the ERC Synergy grant CUBE.
- Builds multidisciplinary teams that span robotics, spectroscopy, structural biology, and computation.

We welcome collaboration requests—from spectroscopy time-sharing to joint supervision of students excited about enzyme mechanisms, spectroscopy, and computational chemistry.

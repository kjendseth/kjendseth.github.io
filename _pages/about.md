Åsmund Røhr Kjendseth leads the Kjendseth Lab at NMBU’s Faculty of Chemistry, Biotechnology and Food Science, where he also serves as Head of Education and Leader for the Chemistry research group (about 20 members). We mix robotics, spectroscopy, and computation to explain how redox enzymes remodel biomass and point the way to resilient biocatalysts.

### Research focus

- Redox chemistry and reaction pathways of copper enzymes
- Spectroscopic probes for enzyme intermediates and oxygen activation
- Computational workflows that integrate quantum chemical and molecular simulations with experiment
- Enzyme engineering strategies employing state-of-the-art AI tools and HPC

### Highlights

- Leads projects with NMBU and US partners on carbon-negative catalysis and enzymatic biomass conversion.
- Principal Investigator on the FRIPRO-funded COOFIX programme and co-PI on the ERC Synergy grant CUBE.
- Builds multidisciplinary team that span automatization, spectroscopy, structural biology, and computational chemistry.

### KJB430 Protein red-ox chemistry (BIOCAT)

Åsmund coordinates and lectures in KJB430, introducing the spectroscopy, kinetics, and structural biology of redox-active enzymes. The course highlights contemporary research on lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases, copper-dependent oxidases, and biocatalytic strategies for sustainable biomass conversion.

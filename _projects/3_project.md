Wetland ecosystems rely on phenolic transformation to regulate carbon flux. Together with collaborators we characterized two tyrosinases from the halophilic bacterium *Hahella* sp. CCB MM4, revealing how salinity and cofactor loading reshape catalytic preferences.

Using stopped-flow kinetics, spectroscopy, and comparative modeling we mapped the active-site determinants that allow these enzymes to thrive in brackish environments. The work guides how we harness tyrosinases for bioremediation and biosynthetic chemistry in saline settings.

We investigate how lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) move electrons and activate oxygen while depolymerizing stubborn biopolymers. By combining time-resolved spectroscopy, advanced EPR, and QM/MM simulations we map hole-hopping routes and catalytic intermediates that control oxidative power.

Recent work resolved how long-range pathways tune activity in fungal AA9 enzymes and uncovered a catalytically versatile AA14 member with unusual redox behavior. These studies offer design principles for tuning LPMO efficiency in enzymatic biomass conversion.

**Core techniques**

* Multi-frequency EPR, UV/Vis kinetics, and stopped-flow spectroscopy  
* Density functional theory and QM/MM models aligned with experiment  
* Structure-guided mutagenesis and kinetic isotope probes

**Impact**

* Mechanistic insight for deconstruction of lignocellulose and chitin-rich feedstocks  
* Frameworks for engineering copper enzymes with tailored selectivity and stability  
* New collaborations across NMBU, TU Graz, and international partners on sustainable bioprocessing

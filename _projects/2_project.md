Many Pseudomonas strains hide enzymatic treasures in cryptic prophage regions. We isolate and characterize these latent endolysins, revealing oxidative muramidases with activity that rivals engineered bacteriophage enzymes. High-resolution kinetics and structural models show how copper-assisted redox partners boost catalytic rates.

**Why it matters**

* Expands the toolbox of antimicrobial enzymes that can disarm resilient Gram-negative pathogens.  
* Illuminates how prophage encoded enzymes cooperate with host metabolism to trigger lysis.  
* Provides new scaffolds for engineering precision antibacterial therapies.
